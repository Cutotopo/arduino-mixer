# ArduinoMixer - Arduino software
This directory contains the software to flash on the Arduino board. It has been tested with an Arduino Nano running an ATMega328P.

Potentiometers should be connected to the analog ports and have their pins defined in the `pms` array by their pins. The `TOTPM` definition should then be adjusted to match the number of channels to create.
